                <p>Hello, my name is Brendan Hellar and I am originally from
                Saratoga, CA.  Saratoga is located deep in Silicon Valley and
                about an hour from San Francisco. I am 29 years old and
                currently reside in Seattle.  I thoroughly enjoy the weather
                in Seattle and hope to make it my permanent place of residence.
